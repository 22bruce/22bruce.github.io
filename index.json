[{"content":"\rSurvey of various organization\u0026rsquo;s take on Agents\rWhat are Agents?\rDifferent people have different definition of agents. Here is what Anthropic has to say about it. They differentiated agents with generall static LLM flows by creating two categories workflows and agents. [1]\nWorkflows: predefined sequence of LLM calls, which are put together to solve a specific problem. For example, you want to know what are the best restaurants available near you. For that, A workflow can be put together like this, 1. API to fetch current location\r2. API to search available near by Restaurants (fetch name, rating, reviews, foods etc.)\r3. LLM to finally read output of step 2, understand rating and reviews and summarize good recommendation. This is pre-defined flow specifically meant to solve queries of restaurant recommendation.\nAgents: on the other hand, agents are the systems where LLMs dynamically directs their own processes and tool usage, complete control over how they want to accomplish task. In the above example, rather than we fetching location and near by restaurant and passing it to LLM, we will give this capabilities to LLM itself. its up to LLM to decide. This kind of system can eventually be autonomous which will have capabilites to solve complex problems. Do you need Agents?\rDefault approach should be workflows, only increase complexity when needed and chose Agents.\nReferences\rBuilding effective agents by Anthropic ","permalink":"http://22bruce.github.io/thoughts/agents/","title":"All about Agents"},{"content":"\rFirst post\rHi, This is my first ever blog post. I am relearning my AI concepts including Math. I have curated a personal learning path of 12 courses with lots of research and I am planning to share all my notes as blog posts here. I belive writing in a way where I have to explain things online helps me understand many concepts better, it will also include many hands on experiment which I would have skipped otherwise.\nYou can alwasy reach out to me on X, I am most active there. link -\u0026gt; https://x.com/bruce_x_offi\nHere with this first post, I want to test few things, code and Math rendering which is essential for AI ML blogs.\nI will also maintain list of good quality resources.\nSample python code,\ndef foo(): print (\u0026#39;bar\u0026#39;) lets check Math,\n$$ \\varphi = 1+\\frac{1} {1+\\frac{1} {1+\\frac{1} {1+\\cdots} } } $$\n","permalink":"http://22bruce.github.io/posts/first/","title":"First post of year"}]
